## [4.31.1] - 2025-10-22

### Added
- NPX temporary directory detection with defense-in-depth architecture

- User-friendly help message with chalk styling when NPX temp directory detected
- Regex patterns to identify macOS NPX temporary paths (`/private/var/folders/.*/npx-/`, `/.npm/_npx/`)
- JSDoc documentation for NPX detection functions

### Fixed
- NPX installation from temporary directory no longer attempts IDE detection
- Clear error message guides users to correct installation directory
- Prevents confusion when running `npx aios-fullstack install` from home directory

- Help message provides actionable solution: `cd /path/to/your/project && npx aios-fullstack install`

### Technical
- Story: 2.3 - NPX Installation Context Detection & Help Text (macOS)
- Defense in depth: Two independent detection layers provide redundancy
- macOS-specific implementation (other platforms unaffected)
- Non-breaking change (patch version)
