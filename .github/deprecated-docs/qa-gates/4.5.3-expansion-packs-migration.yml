  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All references updated correctly. No broken dependencies found. Conservative approach applied for shared tasks.'

    notes: 'Significantly improved maintainability through consistent naming convention across all 6 packs. Documentation updated.'

  future:
    - action: 'Consider adding automated tests for naming convention validation'
      refs: ['expansion-packs/']
      rationale: 'Would catch naming convention violations early in CI/CD pipeline'
    - action: 'Test agent activation for sample agents from each pack'
      refs: ['expansion-packs/']
      rationale: 'Verify runtime behavior unchanged after migration (currently pending QA)'
