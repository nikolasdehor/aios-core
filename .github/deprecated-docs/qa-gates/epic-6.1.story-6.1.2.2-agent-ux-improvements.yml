      refs:
        - .aios-core/agents/*.md
      priority: HIGH

review_notes: |
  STRENGTHS:
  - Tasks 2-5 implemented with high quality and attention to UX
  - Quick Commands sections are clear and actionable
  - Guide documentation is comprehensive and user-focused
  - Agent Collaboration sections provide valuable cross-agent context

  CRITICAL GAP:
  - Task 1 (primary requirement) not implemented despite completion checkbox
  - Suggests task tracking disconnect rather than technical inability

  RECOMMENDATION:
  Return to @dev for Task 1 completion. All other work meets professional standards
  and demonstrates strong UX design capability.

  PROCESS IMPROVEMENT:
  Consider adding automated verification step before "Ready for Review" status to
  catch implementation gaps earlier.
