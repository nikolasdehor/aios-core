  confidence: "HIGH"
  rationale: "All blocking conditions (1 & 2) satisfied. Condition 3 deferred as optimization, not blocker (85% baseline meets threshold). Phase 1 validation successful, Phase 2 greenlit."

notes: |
  Story 1.2 is a VALIDATION REPORT, not an implementation story. This review
  validates that all 3 conditions for PROCEED decision have been satisfied:

  1. ✅ Pedro Validation (Condition 1): Completed 2025-01-18
  2. ✅ Story 1.3 Pilot (Condition 2): Completed in 4h, well under 2d threshold
  3. ⚠️ Keyword Refinement (Condition 3): Deferred, but 85% baseline acceptable

  Key Strengths:
  - Pedro explicitly validated 85% benchmark accuracy
  - Story 1.3 dramatically exceeded timeline expectations (4h vs 2d max, 3-5d estimate)
  - All core assumptions validated with quantitative evidence
  - Phase 2 greenlit with high confidence

  Minor Gaps:
  - Keyword refinement session not yet scheduled (optimization, not blocker)
  - Validation report location non-standard (docs/validation vs docs/stories)

  Overall Assessment: STRONG PROCEED signal for Phase 2-5 continuation.
