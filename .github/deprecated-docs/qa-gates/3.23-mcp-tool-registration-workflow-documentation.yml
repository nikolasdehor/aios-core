    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "Algorithm documentation matches wizard implementation. Validation pipeline status correctly documented as deferred per Story 3.29 QA gate."
  usability:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "Developer can follow README to register tools successfully. Troubleshooting section addresses common issues."

scope_reduction_assessment:
  original_estimate: "5h (full implementation)"
  reduced_estimate: "1h (documentation only)"
  actual_time: "1h"
  justification: "Story 3.29 implemented 74% of original scope (wizard, algorithm, agent updates). Story 3.23 appropriately scoped to documentation and integration."
  savings: "4 hours"
  appropriateness: CORRECT
  notes: "Excellent example of scope reduction based on duplication analysis. PO identified overlap and adjusted scope accordingly."
