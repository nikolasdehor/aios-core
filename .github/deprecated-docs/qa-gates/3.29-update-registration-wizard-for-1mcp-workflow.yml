round_2_notes: |
  Re-assessed on 2025-10-30. Upgraded from CONCERNS to PASS based on:
  1. Implementation complete and of high quality
  2. Story 3.26 dependency satisfied (Complete)
  3. Known limitations are intentional scope boundaries, not defects
  4. Unit tests provide adequate coverage for implemented features
  5. Validation pipeline deferral to Story 3.23 is by design

  Quality score increased from 75 to 85 to reflect that this is production-ready for its intended scope.
