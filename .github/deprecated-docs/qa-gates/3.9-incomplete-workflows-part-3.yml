  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'N/A - Framework metadata changes only, no security implications'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'N/A - No runtime performance impact from YAML frontmatter changes'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All checklist references validated to exist, proper YAML formatting verified'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent - Clear comments for tasks without checklists, TODO comments for missing checklists'

implementation_quality:
  pattern_consistency: EXCELLENT
  yaml_formatting: EXCELLENT
  documentation: EXCELLENT
  edge_case_handling: EXCELLENT

validation_approach:
  method: 'Gap detection script + manual file sampling'
  coverage: 'Complete - all 21 files reviewed'
  effectiveness: 'High - gap detection provides automated validation'

recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: 'Consider creating the 8 missing checklists identified in TODO comments'
      refs:
        - 'agent-creation-checklist.md'
        - 'documentation-checklist.md'
        - 'test-suite-checklist.md'
        - 'task-validation-checklist.md'
        - 'workflow-validation-checklist.md'
        - 'deprecation-checklist.md'
        - 'project-documentation-checklist.md'
        - 'test-generation-checklist.md'
      priority: LOW
      rationale: 'Tasks can function without these checklists, but they would enhance validation coverage'
    - action: 'Consider creating automated YAML frontmatter validation test'
      refs: ['tests/framework/yaml-frontmatter.test.js']
      priority: LOW
      rationale: 'Gap detection script provides sufficient validation, but dedicated test would catch issues earlier'

strengths:
  - 'Consistent implementation pattern across all 21 files'
  - 'Clear rationale comments for tasks not requiring checklists'
  - 'Proper TODO documentation for missing checklists with follow-up notes'
  - '75% under budget - excellent efficiency'
  - 'Follows proven pattern from Stories 3.7 (95/100) and 3.8'
  - 'All acceptance criteria fully met'
  - 'Comprehensive dev notes and documentation'

risk_profile:
  overall_risk: LOW
  probability_of_defects: 0.05
  impact_if_defects: LOW
  rationale: 'Framework metadata changes with no executable code modifications. All checklist references validated. Pattern proven in previous stories.'

technical_debt:
  introduced: NONE
  reduced: HIGH
  notes: 'Story specifically remediates technical debt (22 "Incomplete Flows" gaps). No new debt introduced.'
