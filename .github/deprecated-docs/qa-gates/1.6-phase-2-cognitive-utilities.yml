nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. Tools are read-only with proper input validation. No sensitive data handling or external network calls.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Exceeds requirements. All tools complete in <50ms with avg 33ms, min 32.61ms, max 34.89ms, stddev 0.81ms. Consistent performance across multiple invocations.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent reliability. 100% test pass rate (43/43). Deterministic behavior - same input always produces same output. Comprehensive error handling with proper exit codes (0, 1, 2, 3).'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Highly maintainable. Well-documented with JSDoc comments, clear code structure, consistent patterns across all three tools. Comprehensive documentation (cognitive-tools-guide.md) with usage examples.'

technical_debt:
  identified: false
  notes: 'No technical debt identified. This is new, well-structured code following best practices.'

code_quality_highlights:
  - 'Consistent error handling across all tools with structured JSON error format'
  - 'Cross-platform compatibility achieved through spawnSync with argument arrays'
  - 'Excellent documentation with JSDoc, usage examples, and troubleshooting guide'
  - 'Performance optimization through singleton mind loader and caching'
  - 'Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and performance tests'
