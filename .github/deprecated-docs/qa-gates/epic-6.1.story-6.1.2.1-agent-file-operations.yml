# Gate Decision Summary
decision_summary: |
  Implementation quality is EXCELLENT. All automated verifications passed with zero issues.
  File operations (renames, merge, redirects) executed flawlessly. Manual testing required
  for agent activation verification before marking story "Done".

# Issues Found
issues:
  critical: []
  high: []
  medium: []
  low: []
  technical_debt: []

# Strengths Identified
strengths:
  - Perfect file operations execution
  - Zero data loss in merge
  - Comprehensive backup strategy
  - Clear documentation
  - Backward compatibility via redirect files
  - Clean YAML validation
  - Orion persona preserved

# Risks
risks:
  identified: []
  mitigation: All operations reversible via backups

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  - Complete manual agent activation tests (17 tests)
  - Complete manual functionality tests (5 tests)
  - Create git commit with clean message
  - Verify no broken references in Claude Code after activation
  - Consider documenting redirect file pattern for future agent operations

# Before Marking "Done"
before_done_checklist:
  - automated_verification: COMPLETE
  - manual_activation_tests: PENDING
  - manual_functionality_tests: PENDING
  - git_commit: PENDING
  - verify_no_broken_references: PENDING

# Gate Rationale
rationale: |
  James (@dev) executed YOLO mode implementation with precision. All file operations
  (renames, merges, redirects, backups, documentation) completed perfectly.

  Used redirect files instead of symlinks (Windows limitation handled correctly).
  Merge strategy was optimal: preserved all functionality with clear categorization.
  Documentation quality exceeds expectations.

  No code logic changes means CodeRabbit scan not required. Manual testing needed
  only to verify agent activation works correctly in Claude Code.

  PASS decision is appropriate - ready for production after manual verification.

# Follow-up Actions
follow_up_actions:
  - action: Complete manual testing
    assignee: User
    priority: HIGH
    estimated_time: 15-20 minutes

  - action: Git commit
    assignee: "@github-devops or User"
    priority: HIGH
    dependencies: [manual_testing]

# Additional Notes
notes: |
  - Story involves file operations only, no code logic changes
  - YAML frontmatter validated successfully
  - All 11 agents accounted for (13 original - 2 merged = 11)
  - Backward compatibility maintained via 4 redirect files
  - Full rollback capability via 11 backup files
