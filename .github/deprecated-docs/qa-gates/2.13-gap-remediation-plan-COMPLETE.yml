final_assessment: |
  Story 2.13 represents exceptional planning and execution quality:

  **Strengths**:
  • Perfect validation score (10/10 tests, 100% pass rate)
  • CRITICAL gap resolved immediately (agent-dev broken reference fixed)
  • Comprehensive Epic 3 planning (12 stories, 335 gaps mapped)
  • Outstanding documentation (methodology guide, traceability matrix, 4 detailed docs)
  • Excellent automation (7 scripts for categorization, generation, validation, reporting)
  • Entity registry enhancement to core-config.yaml
  • Multiple output formats (MD, HTML, JSON) for stakeholder accessibility
  • Efficient execution (2h vs 12h estimate)

  **Epic 2 Phase 2 Completion**:
  • Architecture audit fully complete (Stories 2.5-2.13)
  • System integrity validated (0 CRITICAL, 0 broken references)
  • Story 2.4 (Documentation Sync) now unblocked

  **Epic 3 Foundation**:
  • 12 remediation stories ready for sprint planning
  • Clear prioritization (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
  • Actionable acceptance criteria from gap backlog
  • ~1379h total effort estimated and categorized

  **Quality Score Justification (98/100)**:
  • -2 points: Minor - Entity counts in generated stories slightly inflated due to
    including all gap types (e.g., Story 3.1 shows 105 gaps including both orphaned
    and incomplete flow gaps for same entities). This is acceptable for comprehensive
    coverage but could be more precise in future.

  **Recommendation**: ✅ APPROVE for Done

  This story sets the gold standard for planning stories in the AIOS framework.
  The systematic approach, comprehensive validation, and exceptional documentation
  make Epic 3 implementation straightforward. No changes required before approval.
