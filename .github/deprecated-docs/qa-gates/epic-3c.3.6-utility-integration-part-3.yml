gate_decision: PASS
quality_score: 98/100

decision_rationale: |
  Story 3.6 achieves EXCEPTIONAL quality with 100% operational rate (12/12 utilities) - 
  the BEST result in the utility integration series. All 6 acceptance criteria met,
  zero gaps achieved for all utilities, ZERO technical debt, and perfect estimate 
  accuracy (5h/5h). This demonstrates pattern maturity reaching its peak, with the
  cleanest and most successful utility integration of the three stories.
  
  BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVEMENT: 100% operational rate represents the culmination of
  pattern refinement across Stories 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 (87% → 95% → 100%).
