nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'N/A - Framework metadata changes only, no security implications'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'N/A - No runtime performance impact from YAML frontmatter changes'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All checklist references validated to exist, proper YAML formatting verified, gap detection confirms fixes'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent - Clear rationale comments for tasks without checklists, consistent pattern application, comprehensive documentation'

  edge_case_handling: EXCELLENT
  checklist_selection: EXCELLENT

validation_approach:
  method: 'Gap detection script + manual file sampling'
  coverage: 'Complete - all 22 files reviewed, 5 files sampled for YAML validation'
  effectiveness: 'High - gap detection provides automated validation, sampling confirms quality'

recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: 'Continue using this proven pattern for remaining workflow completion stories'
      rationale: 'Pattern has delivered 95-98/100 quality across Stories 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10'
      priority: LOW
    - action: 'Consider automating YAML frontmatter validation as pre-commit hook'
      refs: ['.husky/pre-commit']
      rationale: 'Would catch formatting issues earlier in development cycle'
      priority: LOW

strengths:
  - 'Excellent pattern consistency with proven Stories 3.7-3.9 approach'
  - 'Clear, descriptive rationale comments for tasks not requiring checklists'
  - 'Appropriate checklist selection based on task categorization'
  - '81% under budget - outstanding efficiency (1.5h vs 8h estimated)'
  - 'Comprehensive documentation in completion_notes'
  - 'All acceptance criteria fully met with clear evidence'
  - 'Edge case handling (risk-profile.md YAML correction)'
  - 'Zero phantom gaps - all files exist and remediated'
  - 'Complete checklist coverage - no TODO comments needed'

risk_profile:
  overall_risk: LOW
  probability_of_defects: 0.02
  impact_if_defects: LOW
  rationale: 'Framework metadata changes with no executable code modifications. All checklist references validated. Pattern proven across 4 consecutive stories (3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10).'

technical_debt:
  introduced: NONE
  reduced: HIGH
  notes: 'Story specifically remediates technical debt (22 "Incomplete Flows" gaps). No new debt introduced. All checklists exist - no follow-up work required.'
